## UX Strategy <a name="uxstrategy"></a>
The website was designed to provide a quick general knowledge Trivia Game. The website utilizes another site to provide the subject areas, and functionality has been added to allow users to partake in the quiz, test their knowledge, and try to get a good score. The goal is to provide an entertaining challenge and over time the user can build up their trivia knowledge. The challenge was to build a site encompassing a third party database which will provide a wide range of question topics.

<br/> 

### The Business Goals of the Website: <a name="businessgoals"></a>
- No commercial goals, but the site's goal is to to provide entertainment and build the knowledge base of the users.
  
  <br/> 

### The Target Customer: <a name="targetcustomer"></a>
- The audience of the site could encompass a number of age groups and there would generally not be any limitation on who could avail of the quiz.
- Would probably require some access to digital technology.
- May be useful for a user who has spare time and who would like to test themselves with no judgement or long term commitment.

## Design  
<br/>

## Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>



Wireframes for Desktop, Medium Screens and Mobile Screens.<br/> 
Wireframes were created in Figma. The design of the final site has changed since the wireframe stage. No wireframe was created for the 404.page as it was such a simple layout.

## Colour Scheme    <a name="colourscheme"></a>  

The colour scheme for the website has evolved over time and originally was dark purple, rgb(31, 3, 50) with secondary elements in pink and plum. But after researching other options I was going to strip it back to a white background with colour only on secondary elements to simplify the interface and reduce distractions. Then I discovered a compromise option, where the user can decide what background they would prefer. There is a toggle switch on the top left side of the screen which allows the user to toggle between light and dark mode, there is therefore 2 different colour schemes on the site.


### Light Mode:
Plain white background, White as a background color ensures clarity and manages to remove visual obstacles and clutter, allowing the user to focus on relevant elements and text. It also offers good contrast to aid readability and enhance the user experience overall. The buttons are all uniform and are pink and stand out well from the white background. There is little in regards to imagery, with only 2 visual elements, one representative of brainpower and the toggle image which represents day and night mode. There is also an image in the 404 page. 


### Dark Mode:  
Plain purple background, dark-mode may help to decrease eye strain/dry eyes for some people who spend lots of time looking at screens. There are studies that have concluded dark mode can be more economical and uses less energy at least on mobile screens. Dark-mode is good in low light environments, it can also help people with cataracts or other related visual disorders. By adding white borders around certain elements, it helps them to stand out from the darker background. The buttons and headings still have good contrast in either background.


### Colour Combination in site:
The main colours on the site, the background will be entirely white in light mode but colours tend to be a lighter variation in light mode. The following shows the main colours within the site, not included the textual colours: #47032b   #81044d   #e91e63   #8e399b

</p>


</br> 


## Fonts used on Site  <a name="fonts"></a>

Merriweather was used for the main heading for the site. It has a strong presence and was available in a bold serif type font. It was a good format to apply some styling, to allow it to have a greater visual impact in dark-mode. Merriweather font was designed to be pleasant for screens and so is ideal for the user.

font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;

This font family was used for the majority of the site, both for regular text and headings. Sans serif is the fallback font in case other fonts are not available. 

Shadows into Light was used to add some personalised touches to the site, used when interacting with the users 
i.e. The welcoming text and the closing message to the user when the final score is shown.This font is a neat handwriting font which adds a human element to the application interface.

In relation to the color, I gave the main font the color #313131(when in light mode), it can aid in preventing eye strain and can be used in a multitude of situations. I wanted to enable good user experience throughout the site where possible.

</p>

<br/>

## Icons and Favicon used on site <a name="icons"></a>

I used an Icon of a brain above the heading, I did not want an overbearing image, and instead opted for a small image which gives some context to the Quiz Application. Another icon I used was the image for the day-night toggle on the left hand top of the screen. Other than that the only other icons are the social media icons within the footer element. 

<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/images.jpg"   alt="Images in the site" />   
</p>
       
<br/>


## Structure <a name="structure"></a>    
The Application has gone through a number of transitions. Originally it was 2 pages, an introduction page and a gaming page, but it was later simplified so that only 1 page is used. The introductory section consists of an intoductory blurb, username interput, a welcome message and a start button. When the Start button is pressed the introductory elements are hidden and the main quiz interface is shown. When the game is complete a closing message display is shown. This way the whole website is never shown in full to the user. The site itself grew out of another site, horror-quiz which was my experimental repository, the intention initially was to create a horror quiz using my own question set but I then changed to the Fetch from an API concept. The original Repository can be [found here](https://github.com/MHickey2/Horror-Quiz)

## Features  <a name="features"></a>

### Index Page <a name="indexpage"></a>


The entire application is based in 1 page, with different Elements showing when needed and others are hidden when no longer needed.   
<br/>


#### Username Prompt (See note about replacement)

Although not strictly on the page, the prompt is the first interactive element on the page and is presented to the user on opening the page. The username prompt had been stricter, but did not want to impede the player from partaking in the game. The prompt is presented to the user, they can enter something in the field and this will be attributed to their username in the game and they will be presented with a welcome message. If they dont enter anything and press ok, they will be permitted to play the game. If the user presses cancel, the game will not proceed. I had put in measures to ensure this field could not be blank, but this proved restrictive and I did not want the player to not avail of the game, if they didn't enter a name. In future iterations, stricter measures would be introduced. This would include a second prompt window, as future tweaking would avail of allowing users to save their scores and this would require some identification to be valid. I had looked into personalising the prompt, and this again would be introduced in a future iteration.

Note: This prompt has been replaced at latter stage of the project, and has now been included in the introductory screen as a simple input submit button. You can play as an anonymous Player, as security measures have not been implemented at this stage of development.

<br/>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/username.jpg" alt="prompt_for_username" />
</p>



#### Intro Section:    

The Intro Section consists of the Logo, which is a brainpower Icon and a main heading and there is also an intro to the game central message. It now also includes the username request section (see above). Content is simple and to the point, it is just a quick quiz, so felt the opening should be brief.     

<br/>


<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/IntroSection.jpg" alt="introSection" />  
</p>

#### Light/Dark Toggle:

The original concept was that the website would be a dark colour and all elements would be conducive with this colour scheme, but as the site progressed, I wanted to strip the colour back and try a lighter theme, on further research I managed to do both. Initially there were some issues, in that I had font colours within many of the body elements, so the toggle was not working as affectively as it should, but when I stripped out the colours and left the body take over that responsibility, the light and dark mode was effectively accomplished. There are still some alternative font colours but that is where I wanted these fonts to be distinguisable and these had to have good contrast with both the dark and light mode.    
<br/> 



<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/toggledark.jpg" alt="ToggleDarkMode" />  
  <img src="assets/images/readme/togglelight.jpg" alt="ToggleLightMode" />  
</p>



#### Start Button:

The Start Button is the last element on the initial screen view (besides the footer, which will relocate when button is pressed) and it will when pressed show the full game interface. The Introductory section will be removed, but the welcome text will remain. 

<br/>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/startbtn.jpg" alt="StartButton" />  
</p>

### The Game Interface:

This will consist of a panel with the difficulty and category panel with information on each question asked and a question number which will help the user understand their progress level in the game and it will indicate the number of questions to be asked, and the questions to be asked themselves.

<br/>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/gameInterface.jpg" alt="gameInterface" />  
</p>

### Answer Section and Next Button:

The answers will be displayed in a series of buttons. When the right button is selected, it will turn green and if the selection is incorrect it will turn red. The next Button allows the user to chose the next question. Initially there was going to be a timer for the quiz, but this has since been removed, so there presently is no constraint on the time taken in the quiz. The next button allows the user time to ponder each question, and clears the fields of the colour changes that have occured.  

<br/>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/answersAndNext.jpg" alt="answersAndNextButtons" />  
</p>

### End Section:

There is a verification answer panel, which shows the user the correct answer for each question. There is also a running total of correct and incorrect scores. When the game has completed its cycle, an alert button is displayed to the user.(Will probably be replaced by a modal, but ran out of time).  

<br/>

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/gameover.jpg" alt="gameover" />  
</p>

<br/>

### Closing Message and Restart Button:   


When the game is over, the verification answer panel will be hidden and a closing message panel will be shown. This will show the final Score to the user, and a parting comment on how well they did on the Quiz. If the user wants to repeat the game, they can do this by pressing the Restart Button, which will refresh the game and they will be presented with the opening page again, where they have the option to repeat the opening process.  

<br/>

<br/>

## Future <a name="future"></a> 
<br/>


There were a number of features that were trialed within this application and they would be included in future iterations including:

- A more rebust functionality for requesting usernames that will ensure a username would need to be supplied by the user, this would be important when user scores could be saved at the end of the game and could be a good way to introduce a level of competition with other quiz players on the site.
- An extra level of complexity, would be to add a timer element, where the game would end after a certain level of time has been surpassed.
- I had intended to introduce sound, when there was a correct and incorrect answer, but I didn't in the end, but may add a celebratory tone, when a high score is achieved at the end of a game. The key to sound is to use sparingly if at all.
- I would probably allow users to choose the number of questions they want to answer, and this would involve changing the final messages to accomodate different question sets. Maybe introduce a percentile instead of a number count, as this could be better able to deal with scale.
- At the moment session storage is being used, but with introducing scores, it would open up needs for long term storage. Competitors could test their scores, against existing high scorers. This may require a database to hold scores long term.
- In relation to interactivity, there could be an element of social interactivity. Present social media sites could be used to encourage fellow competitors to communicate within these channels, or a dedicated forum on the site itself could be a great platform to encourage communication.

## Bugs and Issues <a name="bugs"></a>



<br/>  

### Resolved Issues <a name="resolved"></a>  

The first issue was trying to get information from the API to the webpage, The Code Institute module was the first place I looked at, and it was a great starting point for working with APIs. I used a variety of Tutorials online, which are mentioned in the media section, and I used Tutor support to resolve some early issues. 

The API itself sends the answers in a specific format and another issue was tring to sort the answers so that the right answer was not always in the number 1 position, I used the sort method to resolve this issue.

I used information from the Love Maths module to learn how to increment the scores, but had an issue with showing final scores for the game, which was resolved with storing the variable in session storage, which I used for a number of variables.

The prompt has been replaced and it is mentioned in the features section)
The username prompt was a temporary measure, and the hope is to introduce a more customised Responsive and Accesable (WAI-ARIA) replacement for Javascript's pop-up windows. I had experimented with this [site](https://sweetalert2.github.io/#input-types) in regards to the username prompt and category and difficulty modules, but would have involved an updated version of javascript and was wary of introducing a new version, as it could have caused issues with existing elements. This site would be worth exploring for all future projects. 

<br/>




### Unresolved Issues  <a name="unresolved"></a>



<br/>

One unfixed bug relates to user giving inputs that will change the criteria in the API Fetch Request, I managed to create 2 modal forms, which were taking user input and assigning the answers to session stoarage, the plan was to use the inputted choices in literal strings in the fetch request, despite multiple sessions in resolving this issue, at the eleventh hour, the choice was made to remove these options. The fetch api was still fetching request before utilizing the user inputs, this would be an issue to be fixed in future iterations, however it is present for a great deal of the project and there is some information on these elements in the TEST.md, to explain the reasoning of the plan and the execution, despite no resolution being found at this time.

#### Category and Difficulty Section: (Formerly a feature, but now outside project scope)

When using the API, I wanted to introduce more interactivity and allow the user to search for questios based on their requirements. Initially these options would have been on the first page and based on their input they would be presented with the result of their chosen criteria. When the change was made to have one page, I devised these options would be available in modals. Each modal has radio buttons and the values would be used as literal strings in the fetch request. There have been issues integrating user input into the fetch request. The fetch request does have default settings and will, despite this fetch generic options and generic difficulty levels, so if these options can't be utilised in this iteration, the hope is to fix this issue and allow users more control over the quiz options in the future. These options are now optional, but will be removed if issue is not resolved. (See images below).

<br/>


<p align="center">

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/modal1.jpg" alt="CategoryModal" />  
  <img src="assets/images/readme/modal2.jpg" alt="DifficultyModal" />  
</p>

Another bug exists in that more than one option can be selected in the answers, this would need to be refactored so that you can only choose one button, and would probably be better utilized in a loop. The present set up will work, but can cause erroneous scores, if not played in the right way.

### Code

I did refer to a variety of Tutorials when compiling functions, different concepts from different video tutorials were integrated into the application on an ongoing basis. I believe this was the first one I looked at, but changes were made to fit into my project, but this would have been the starting block, and it relates to the [Build a Quix App with JavScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k) Video.
