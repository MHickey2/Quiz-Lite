## Browser Testing<a name="browsertesting"></a>

  The site was tested in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Brave Browser on the Desktop.
  The site was tested on a Lenovo Laptop, an Acer Aspire Netbook and older iphone5(limited functionality).  

  Appearance and Functionality appeared consistent in all browsers on the Desktop, but on the older iPhone5
  the WebP images could not be seen, on this older model, Safari does not support these images but in September 2020 onward, WebP support was added in Safari version 14.

## Responsive Testing<a name="responsivetesting"></a>

   I regularly tested the responsiveness of the site using Google Chrome Developer tools, information on this can be found [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/). I also used Window Resizer and a Responsive Design Tester Application available in the Google Chrome Store. The devices I tested for are in the image below.  

   <br/>
   <p align ="center">      
     <img src="assets/images/readme/resptests.png"  alt="responsive test results"/>     
   </p>
   
   
   I also used [https://ui.dev/amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) and it was a useful way to see how the site was progressing in regards to reponding to different screen sizes. The image showing responsiveness can be seen below.

   <br/>
   <p align ="center">      
     <img src="assets/images/readme/amiresp1.png"  alt="Am I responsive results"/>   
   </p>
   <br/>

   Should be responsive down to 320px screen, but any smaller and there will be issues. In regard to bigger screens it should be good to ?px. The website is not responsive for the Galaxy Fold, but this is not within my current scope anyway.

   The Media Query Breakpoints I used were:
   - 600px width and below;
